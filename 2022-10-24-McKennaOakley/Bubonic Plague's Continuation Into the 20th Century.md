While encoding my 1906-10-17 issue of the *Egyptian Gazette*, I was enthralled by mention of the bubonic plague in the “Local and General” section. The bubonic plague is a bacterial infection commonly carried by fleas and rats that causes fever, swollen lymph nodes, and even gangrene in the extremities, hence its nickname the ["Black death"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123213001380). I was familiar with this plague’s epidemic in Western Europe during the 14th century, but I had not realized that the plague continued to infect humans. Upon further research, I learned that there was [a second epidemic of the bubonic plague in India](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033350607000145) throughout the 19th and 20th centuries for about five decades. Cases of bubonic plague persist around the world [still even to this day](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/49/5/736/308284), which I found particularly intriguing; it completely dumbfounded my previous notions that the plague no longer existed. Specifically in the context of Egypt in the early 20th century, I learned from [past student blog posts](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-migdalski/) that the plague was most prevalent in 1904, followed by an immediate, drastic decrease in 1905. In fact, there was a bulletin posted in October of 1905 that read ["NO MORE PLAGUE."](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-eugenio/) Within just two years, the total cases dropped to zero, which I found compelling considering the plague’s reputation of spreading viscously. My issue’s report of the plague’s reappearance further complicates the issue of the bubonic plague in early 20th century Egypt; what allowed the plague to dwindle down and reappear? What specific conditions fostered an epidemic in India but not in Egypt when they were dealing with the same disease? These are questions that microhistorical data in the *Egyptian Gazette* can help answer.
